    <h2>Eros Service Overview</h2>
    <p>
    The architecture development team has implemented an application using the
    Java language named Eros that addresses these issues.
    Eros is designed to allow all applications to have their errors handled
    consistently.  This provides many benefits such as a single point of
    monitoring for support staff.  Also application developers do not have to
    reinvent the wheel each time with regards to logging their errors.
    </p>
    <p>
    A client simply passes the error message to Eros, and can be confident
    that it will be logged centrally.  No matter where physically on the
    network this request is made, Eros will ensure that the error is sent to
    the central server for logging.  Eros handles the sending mechanism from
    the client to the server wherever they may be.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are essentially two parts to Eros, the client side and the server side.
    The client side is the part that applications interact with to log an error.
    The server side handles the logging of the error in the central store.
    </p>
    <p>
    When the client makes a request to log an error, the client side of Eros
    initially tries to locate a running server side of Eros.  The client side
    discovers any available servers on the network.  Once a server is located,
    the error detail is sent and the client is guaranteed the error has been
    logged.
    If no server is available the error will be place into a queue to be retried
    at an elapsed interval.
    </p>
    <p>
    The server side of Eros then performs the logging of the error detail in
    the central store, currently a table in the Oracle database.
    When the error is received the details are extracted and stored in the
    Oracle table.  If for any reason the database is unavailable then Eros
    will place the error in a queue and will try again after an elapsed time.
    </p>
    <p>
    The main detail of the error stored is:
    <ul>
    <li>The date and time of the error.</li>
    <li>The application in which the error occurred.</li>
    <li>The message associated with the error.</li>
    <li>The area of code in which the error occurred.
        (In most cases the exact line number)</li>
    <li>Any key pieces of data that will assist in the investigation/resolution
        of the error.  E.g. policy number, case reference, record number etc.</li>
    <li>An error code that may relate to a resolution hint that can be
        displayed to support staff.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    The details in the table can then be viewed from any application that can
    interact with the Oracle database.  This could be a web page, an Oracle
    form or a Java application.  If using a web page then support staff can
    access this information from any computer in the building, and even in the
    future via the internet.
