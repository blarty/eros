<h1>Eros - First steps</h1>

<h2>Scripts</h2>
The Eros distribution contains two 'run' scripts - <i>runeros</i> and <i>runui</i><br>
Both scripts are started from the command line. runeros will start the service instance, and runui will run start a serviceui client to an eros instance

<h2>Default database</h2>
Eros ships with hsqldb, and a database log that has the error tables pre-setup. Using this, Eros should automatically start and allow you to log errors straightaway.


<h2>Using another database</h2>
In the <i>config/sql</i> directory you will find a set of scripts that will auto generate the required database objects for a number of different databases<br><a>Currently there are scripts for:
<ul>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
You will need to include your database vendor jars and alter the <i>storeconfigxml</i> property in the post install configuration (run <i>eros_post_install</i>)
